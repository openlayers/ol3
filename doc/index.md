Finding your way round
======================
See the class list to the right and especially take a look at ol.Map and ol.layer.Layer because those are the central objects.

In general every use ofÂ OpenLayers starts by initializing a map, then adding the required layers. Controls and interactions can be added to change the behavior of the map.

Projections
===========
Projections define which point on earth is represented by a pair of coordinates. Coordinates within OpenLayers can be used in various projections where some common projections are always supported, others can be using via Proj4js.

Maps and Layers
===============
A map in OpenLayers is essentially a staple of layers that is viewed from the top. Layers are responsible for retieving data and displaying it.

Contributing
============
See CONTRIBUTING.md for instructions on building and tesing OpenLayers. The file does also describe how to commit your changes to OpenLayers.
