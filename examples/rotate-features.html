title: Rotate Features
shortdesc: Example of a rotate features interaction.
docs: >
  This example demonstrates how the rotate and select interactions can be used
  together. Zoom in to an area of interest and click to select a feature. Then
  drag the feature around to rotate it.
  By default, it rotates from the center of the extent of the geometry. To
  rotate from the cursor position, hold <code>Shift</code> key. To limit the
  rotation by multiple of 8th of PI, or 22.5Â°, hold <code>Ctrl</code>
  (<code>Command</code> on Mac)
