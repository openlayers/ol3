title: Circle Comparison
shortdesc: Comparison of circle geomtry and a circular polygon
docs: >
  A circle geometry created via `ol/geom/Circle` will use the unit of the coordinate
  reference system for the radius. Except for local projections projection units cannot
  accurately represent true distances across the extent of a projection as the relative
  scale or point resolution can vary considerably, especially for global projections such
  as web mercator. A circle with a radius of 1000 km in projection units is shown in red,
  and another with 1000 km radius adjusted for point resolution is shown in green.

  Adjustment for point resolution is sufficient for a small radius, but with a larger
  radius the point resolution can also vary within the radius, so a circle on the
  Earth's surface will not be a circle geometry on a flat projection. To overcome this
  `ol/geom/Polygon` provides the `circular` method to create a circle approximation
  based on spherical geometry. A polygon with a geodesics great-circle radius of 1000 km
  is shown in blue.
