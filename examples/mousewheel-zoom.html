title: Mousewheel/Trackpad Zoom
shortdesc: Shows advanced wheel/trackpad zoom options.
docs: >
  This example uses a custom `module:ol/interaction/MouseWheelZoom` configuration:

   * By default, wheel/trackpad zoom is always active, which can be unexpected
     on pages with a lot of scrollable content and an embedded map. To perform
     wheel/trackpad zoom actions only when the map has the focus, set
     `condition: ol.events.condition.focus` as constructor option. This requires
     a map div with a `tabindex` attribute set.
   * By default, the interaction can leave the map at fractional zoom levels. If
     instead you want to constrain wheel/trackpad zooming to integer zoom
     levels, set `constrainResolution: true`.
