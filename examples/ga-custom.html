title: GeoAdmin custom config example
shortdesc: Layer's custom configuration.
docs: >
  <p>The default settings for the layer's configuration are provided by the <a href="http://api3.geo.admin.ch/rest/services/api/MapServer/layersConfig" target="_blank">layersConfig</a> service. You may want to override some value, for instance the <em>timestamp</em>, the <em>opacity</em> or if the layer is <em>queryable</em> or not.</p>
  <p>In this example, we choose to change the opacity of the background map to 0.4, and display the aerial photography of the year <b>1954</b> only (by default you would have all available year from 1924 to today).</p>
