title: SuperCluster Map
shortdesc: Example of a clustered points.
docs: >
  This page uses an `ol.source.ImageVector` to consume clustered vector with style set using a `createClusterIcon` function.

  The clustered source is the result of the use of [supercluster](https://github.com/mapbox/supercluster), a third party JavaScript library dedicated to clustering.

  To improve performance, we use HTML5 web worker and consume Earthquakes data as GeoJSON as `supercluster` uses GeoJSON as input.
